We use bootstrap as an external shop for our styles!

BOOTSTRAP STYLES ARE PREDEFINED, you could overwrite them if you want!

Bootstrap has a system called GRID SYSTEM!

SCREEN --> CONTAINERS --> ROWS --> COLUMNS



SUMMATION SHOULD BE EQUAL TO 12!!!


XS -- SM -- MD -- LG -- XL

XS is for mobile
"col-xs-12" :: here 12 because we only want one column on a page


SM is for tablet
"col-sm-6" :: here 6 because we only want TWO columns on a page
i.e. 6 + 6 equals 12

MD is for laptop
"col-md-4" :: here 12 because we only want one column on a page
4 + 4 + 4 equalts 12
